# Getter Chrome Extension

## About This Project

Welcome to the Getter chrome extension

This project was created to help developers and designers to grab styles, images, etc off any page for quick development.

With this extension a user can see the following css on any webpage:

- Colors
- fonts
- font sizes
- images
- more coming soon!


A special thanks goes to Amanda Billings, an awesome designer. She helped create the images for the extension and was crucial in testing the extension.
